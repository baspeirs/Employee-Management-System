This application uses the node package Inquirer to ask you questions, and display requested information. With this application, you can view, add, and delete departments, roles, and employees from your terminal. Information submitted by adding departments, roles, or employees is sent to an SQL database and stored, which can then be accessed for viewing, or removeing from the database. There is no data in the database to start, so you will first need to create some departments, then roles, then finally, your staff.
